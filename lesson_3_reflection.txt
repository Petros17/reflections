1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When working on different computers, or when multiple people contribute to a same repository


2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-There might be files on local repository that are still in use, or files on remote repository that are not yet meant to be pulled. 
Keeping it manual is the best way.
